def detector_direction(incidence: float, tilt: float, design_angle: float,
                       verbose: bool = False) -> Tuple[float, float, float]:
    '''
    Determines the direction vector of the detector by solving a quadratic
    equation that arises from the following system of equations:

    .. math::

        x\\sin(\\Theta_i) + z\\cos(\\Theta_i) = -\\cos(\\Theta_0)

        y\\cos(\\Theta_t) - z\\sin(\\Theta_t) = 0

        x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1

    In the above equations :math:`\Theta_i` is the angle of incidence,
    :math:`\\Theta_t` the detector tilt angle and :math:`\\Theta_0` the
    design angle, i.e. the angle between the source and detector.

    The first equation is the dot product of the detector direction vector
    and the direction of the incident beam. The angle between the two is
    the design angle :math:`180 - \\Theta_0`. The second equation is
    the dot product of the detector direction vector and the normal
    of the tilted plane that contains the detector direction vector. Note
    that the tilted plane is the x-z plane rotated around the x axis.

    The solution with negative z component that has a polar angle
    in the x-z plane smaller than the polar angle of the incident source
    is taken (detector always rotates from source towards the x axis).

    Parameters
    ----------
    incidence: float
        Source incidence angle (radians) in the x-z plane, measured from
        the z axis.
    tilt: float
        Detector tilt angle (radians) measured as the angle between the
        tilted plane (x-z plane rotated around the x axis) and the z axis. 
    design_angle: float
        Design angle between the source and detector (radians).
    verbose: bool
        Enables verbose report.

    Returns
    -------
    dir: np.ndarray
        Direction vector of the detector.
